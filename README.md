# Knowledge-based-geovisualisation
This project addresses semantic challenges of geovisualisation by employing Semantic Web technologies. We develop a knowledge representation approach coupling ontologies and semantic rules for representing and using the geovisualisation knowledge.
There are two main folders in this project:

	ontologies: contains all the ontologies designed and used in this study
	
	rules: contains all example rules used for the case study of'Stockholm heritage building map'
